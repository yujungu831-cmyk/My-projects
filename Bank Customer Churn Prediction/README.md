# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

**Target:**
Develop algorithms for bank services based on annotated data, and use Python algorithms to predict the churn of bank customers.

**Data source:**
Simulated dataset

**required python module**

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- sklearn

**Methods:**

- data exploration
- Feature Preprocessing
- Model Training(including Logistic Regression, KNN and Random Forest)
- Result Evaluation 
- Practical Business

**Main steps:**

 1. import data and analyze it with charts.
 2. drop useless data and split it
 3. encode data
 4. standardize data
 5. build models and train them
 6. find the better parameters
 7. compare three models and find the best one
 8. compare the feature importance
 9. apply in practice

**Key conclusion:**

 - Random Forest is the best model
 - Age is the most important factor affecting the churn of bank customers
