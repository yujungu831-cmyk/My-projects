# LendingClub Loan Prediction

**Target:**
Build charts and maps with business insights to provide key risk indicators.

**Data source:**
Simulated dataset

**required python module**

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- sklearn
- plotly

**Methods:**

- data exploration
- Data cleaning
- Feature Preprocessing
- Model Training(including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC and Random Forest)
- Result Evaluation 

**Main steps:**

 1. import data and analyze it with charts.
 2. Predict the potential impact of data on the results
 3. drop useless data and split it
 4. encode data
 5. deal with missing value
 6. standardize data
 7. build models and train them
 8. use ``classification_report()``to show the results
 9. compare three models and find the best one
 10. compare the feature importance


**Key conclusion:**

 - Logistics Regression model performed the best in this project.
 - The most influential factors are int_rate, annual_inc, term.
 - The final result roughly conforms to the initial EDA.
